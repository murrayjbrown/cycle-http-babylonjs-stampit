# cycle-app

A simple reactive web application, based on [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) and the [Cycle.js](https://cyclejs.org/) framework, which presents a query form and uses an HTTP driver to obtain information about (bogus) users via the REST API at [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). It also has a custom driver for the [Babylon](https://babylonjs.com) game engine and demonstrates the use of embedded reusable components.
